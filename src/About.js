        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Taylor Daniels! I currently study Software Engineering at ECPI University.
            I really like to listen to music, and I tend to hyper-focus on different hobbies from time to time
            due to having ADHD. So sometimes I really like playing with micro-controllers and LED strips to make cool 
            art, or sometimes I'm really committed to learn how to skateboard again. 
        </p>
